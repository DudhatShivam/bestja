GooDoo
======

GooDoo (codename: BestJa) is an utility for professional management of
volunteers’ work.

There are two websites for which GooDoo has been created, owned by
`Federacja Polskich Banków Żywności <http://bankizywnosci.pl/>`__ and
`Uniwersyteckie Centrum Wolontariatu
<http://wolontariat.uw.edu.pl/>`__. Modules related to these websites
are marked with suffixes ``_fpbz`` and ``_ucw``, respectively.

Modules that are not prefixed with ``bestja_`` may be used outside of
the GooDoo ecosystem.

Installation
------------

GooDoo modules require Odoo 8 to run. Python dependencies
are listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file.
